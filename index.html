									Hi, my name is Dante. I’m Polish, raised in the UK and moved to Melbourne 12 years ago. I've graduated high school and started my first year bachelor degree in IT at RMIT this year. In my spare time, I follow F1,  playing video games, watching YouTube, karting and trading cryptocurrencies.

I graduated from the class of 2020 in highschool and am currently completing a bachelor of IT at RMIT. I spend my time mostly watching Netflix, practising piano, drawing and eating.

I don’t have much experience in IT as I spent the most time on everchanging after school activities and stressing about class. However, I also became interested in robotics and AI when I attended an IT/Engineering seminar in which we assembled and coded our own robot.

									My name is Yifan Wang, you can also call me Charles. My student number is s3894453. And my email address is s3894453@student.rmit.edu.au. I am an international student, and I am from China. I arrived in Australia in 2016 and started learning at Melbourne language centre at Boxhill. After half a year's learning, I got a level four certificate (which is the highest level) and graduated from the Language Centre! I started learning at Viewbank College in year 9. Because they do not have many international students, My English is improving fast at that time, but still struggling to understand in class. At the end of year 9, I did well in the AEAS test, and transferred to Mentone Grammar at the start of year 10. And I kept learning at Mentone Grammar until I graduated. Before I came to Australia, I played Taekwondo for 6 years, and won championships in different levels of games. But after living for 4 years, my weight went from 120 kg to 180 kg. I like to play video games. For online games, I play League of Legends, CS:GO, Valorant, FIFA and 2k.

							<p>Hi, my name is Jerzy Filatow and I'm the trial performance lead at ANZ bank Australia.
									<br>
									<br>
								As the tribal performance leader for my area, I look after the portfolio which is accountable for the fraud and financial crime technology systems that operate within the bank. And a big part of my job is managing the teams. I've got about 100 people that work under me, that both manage services and contracts. And what we do is manage the systems and the technical processes that underpin the bank's ability to detect and automatically deal with threats of financial crime and fraud that happened internally and externally from the bank
								So the industry that I work in is the finance and banking industry. It is a very big consumer of IT services. Fintechs is an up-and-coming technology area where effectively we provide financial services, both online and physical services for customers to manage their home loans, credit cards, and just standardized banking requirements. We also support institutional and other large industrial areas, such as Corporate Australia and large companies in managing payroll and other items as well.
								<br>
									<br>
								So other aspects of my role, apart from the management of the systems themselves, is to work with, you know, several other very important components that they're required to be done as part of performing or running any company. One of those would be the management of human collateral, the management of finances and budget, and the management of operating risk within the area. All of those things are very important. They're non-technical pieces of work that require us to sit down and do a lot of planning and discuss various different aspects of risk and exposure and the consequences could be financial, or they could be human. And then working through those. So yeah, there is, I would say, especially my role, a big component is managing not just the systems, but actually the people and the talent that we have within our area.
								<br>
									<br>
								So within my area, we interact with a number of different people. We deal with the business management aspects. So they're the heads of the various financial crime and fraud business units that we work with to ensure that they get what they need. We deal with the engineers and the analysts that they're actually supporting and running the systems. We deal with senior managers at different levels that have accountability for the overall running of the technology systems and just ensure that they have clarity and understanding of what we're doing. We don't have direct exposure to customers, especially in my space. Our systems are quite internal, and they support I guess what you could say back-office processes.
								<br>
									<br>
								Some of the other IT professionals that I work with, usually, I would say I work mostly with architects. So we have technology area architects, I've got one that works within my area. And we have to talk with other people and other architects in other areas, especially when we're trying to do an initiative that traverses the boundaries of my portfolio. So negotiating priorities. Maybe we need some resources, or maybe, you know, when our systems interact, and we need to get data we need to sync up to ensure that we integrate with other systems that operate within the bank successfully. So there are analysts or technical analysts, business analysts, engineers, which is just a word for it comes as developers and other people that have tech-specific technical skills. We have product owners within our space, we're an agile organization. And those people run and prioritize or work for those technology teams, and, and also Scrum masters another agile concept, people that actually help prioritize and run the team successfully and ensure that the work actually keeps flowing.
								<br>
									<br>
								We don't actually interact with clients and investors directly. As probably mentioned earlier, we are an internally facing team. And we're a big organization. So all of our clients actually have internal Business and Technology teams and yeah investors outside of our area.
								<br>
									<br>
								I spend a lot of time managing, I guess, the relationships that fall within my area. So managing up into the business, managing down into the people that work for me and ensuring that their needs are met as well. So the human aspects are a very big part of my role. Another big aspect of where my time is spent in managing the finances and risk and ongoing operations of my area. And then finally, I would say, managing expectations and dependencies of initiatives. So when my team struggles to secure a commitment with another tribe, in my space, I would then go in and try to help negotiate an outcome that would align to getting that initiative moving forward and successfully completed.
								<br>
									<br>
								So probably the most challenging part of the role is actually the human capital management and ensuring that the people have what they need. And we have enough people to satisfy the requirements and the needs of the businesses. I think right now, one of the biggest challenges that we're facing with COVID is, you know, the impact that it has on our offshore teams, especially in India, and try to manage the risk around that we have a lot of dependencies around, you know, then being able to support us, and just ensuring that we can, can have contiguity for the services and the customers that reside within Australia. So there's a lot of, I guess, things that are unplanned, that kind of crop up that you have to deal with on an ongoing basis. And then when those things don't happen, you would have the normal kind of attrition of staff and the challenges around the budgets and ensuring that we are adequately funded to do what we need to do.
								<br>
									<br>
								Okay, so an example of something that we're doing that encompasses the industry. So right now there is a massive push to move services into the cloud. And we, as a bank, have a lot of obligations when it comes to ensuring that customers’ data is kept private and that we don't put it out there without adequate controls. So the move to the cloud is somewhat sort of faces off and sort of competes with our objectives of ensuring that we have adequate security in place to protect customer data. And so we are currently working through a process with Google and Amazon, who are the two main cloud providers at ANZ to ensure that we can put in our services where be no fraud and other data services into the cloud so that we can maintain security for customers but also meet the obligations of our regulators, ensuring that they that we are treating customers data seriously and with respect, and and and provide them a level of security and performance as well.
